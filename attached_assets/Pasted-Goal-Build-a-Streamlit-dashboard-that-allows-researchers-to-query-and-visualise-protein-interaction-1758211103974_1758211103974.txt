Goal: Build a Streamlit dashboard that allows researchers to query and visualise protein interactions (direct binding partners and indirect effects) and to predict new interactions using state of the art models.
Tasks:
1.	Set up the environment:
o	Create a new Python Repl and add a requirements.txt file listing the required packages: streamlit, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, plotly, openpyxl, torch, dgl (or torch-geometric), transformers and any model specific dependencies.
o	In main.py, import streamlit as st, pandas as pd, numpy as np, and the machine learning libraries.
2.	Load and cache data:
o	Use st.cache_data to load the EGCG_Direct_Interactions.csv and EGCG_Indirect_Effects.csv into Pandas DataFrames. Ensure that the column names (e.g., protein, gene, interaction_type, affinity, evidence_category, species, disease_context) are preserved.
o	Add a function get_known_interactions(query_protein, species, disease) that filters these DataFrames based on the user’s query.
3.	Implement feature extraction and models:
o	Write a helper function to retrieve sequence and (optionally) structure data for a protein identifier. If no external API is available, mock this with placeholder sequences.
o	Implement a simple baseline classifier using scikit learn (e.g., SVM or Random Forest) trained on existing interaction data pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.
o	(Advanced) Include a GNN model for binary interaction prediction and a graph transformer + EGNN model for predicting PPI sites pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.govarxiv.org. Load pre trained weights or train briefly on the uploaded datasets.
o	Provide a function predict_interaction(proteinA, proteinB, model_type) that returns a confidence score and predicted interface residues.
4.	Design the Streamlit interface:
o	Use a sidebar for user inputs: text input for the query protein, select boxes for species (e.g., human, rat), checkboxes for disease contexts (neurodegenerative, anti aging, gut, cardiovascular) and radio buttons to choose the prediction model.
o	Display summary metrics on the main page: number of known direct interactions, number of indirect effects, top 5 binding partners ranked by affinity, etc.
o	Render interactive tables (st.dataframe) for direct and indirect interactions with built in filters (species, evidence type, disease). Provide a download button (st.download_button) to export filtered data as CSV/Excel.
o	Add charts using Plotly: a bar chart of binding affinities (log scale) for known direct interactions and a pie chart showing the distribution of evidence categories. Use altair or box plots to visualise affinity distributions by evidence type.
o	When the user requests a prediction for a new protein pair, display the predicted interaction probability and, if using a PPI site model, highlight the top predicted interface residues.
5.	Enhance usability:
o	Add caching to avoid re computing predictions when inputs haven’t changed.
o	Use expandable sections (e.g., st.expander) to show/hide advanced model options or model explanation text. Streamlit supports st.expander and st.tabs for multi tab layouts.
o	Include a README or in app documentation that explains the data sources, the meaning of direct vs. indirect interactions, and the underlying models.
6.	Run the app:
o	From the Replit shell, run pip install -r requirements.txt and streamlit run main.py. The app should open automatically in the browser. Verify that data tables and charts render correctly and that predictions appear when requested.
7.	Iterate and polish:
o	Adjust the layout for readability on different screen sizes.
o	Profile the model functions for performance and consider using smaller neural models if resource limits are reached on Replit.
o	Test the app with several protein queries to ensure reliability and accuracy.
